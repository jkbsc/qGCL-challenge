The challenge program uses a random choice between two options and equal probability each, i.e. 0.5. the code is this, with annotations in braces. I have used (+) to indicate the random choice.

```
{1/N} # precondition
var c, v = 0, 1
while(V<N or c>=N){
    {Inv x [v < N or C >= N]}
    [] (v <= N) -> v = 2v
        c = 2c (+) c = 2c+1
    [] (v > N) -> v,c=v-N,c-N
    {Inv}
}
{ [c=i] } # Post condition for any 0 <= i < N
```
The two guarded commands inside the while loop above govern two different loop constructs.

So, we convert to nested loops, first using repeat for the out loop:

```bash
# nested loops, with repeat (but broken and incomplete, see the next refinement for better):

{ 1/N } # precondition
var v=1
var c=0
repeat {
   ...
      while (v<N or c>=N){
         {Inv and (v<N or c >= N)}
         : (v <= N ) -> v = 2v; c=2c (+) c=2c+1

         {Inv}
         }
      : (v > N )  -> v = v - N ; c = c - N
      } until (v>=N and c < N)
{(c = i) for some 0<=i<N} # Postcondition
```
Now modify the initialisation so that the outer loop can be expressed as a while:

```bash
# Inv includes c<v, N=1 or v<2N

{ 1/N } # precondition
var v=N+1
var c=N
while (c >= N){
   {Inv1 and c >=N}
                          # need to show N=1 or v<2N
   v = v - N ; c = c - N  # don't need the guard, (v > N) ->, since v>c>=N

   while (v<N){
       {Inv2 and (v<N)}   #  don't need 'or (c >= N)', in part because it is false, since c<v and v<N
                          #  but mostly because it controls the outer while loop, not the inner loop
       v = 2v; c=2c (+) c=2c+1
       {Inv2}
       }
   {Inv1}
   }
```
The algorithm terminates when N is a power of 2, after one cycle of the outer loop.

From now on, we set N not a power of 2, unless explicitly included.

The state space is a vector of pairs, length l, representing (c, p_c) where p_c means the probability of arriving at c.

We should be able to show that l=v
```
state_space=V(:0<=i<l:(i,p_i))
```
Want all p_i to be the same.
```
A(i,j:0<=i,j<l:p_i=p_j)  # this is part of the invariant
```
Should be able to prove that sum(p_i) < 1 (for N not a power of 2).

{(c = i) for some 0<=i<N and A(i,j:0<=i,j<N: P(c=i)=P(c=j))} # Postcondition

Need to show that Post follows from v>=N and N>c and Inv1 and Inv2

Want to show that the probablity of termination converges to 1/N with each outer cycle

Want to show that the state space is recursive or self-similar, i.e. fractal

Want to show that the probability of getting into the next recursive part is a fixed fraction and therefore that the probability of the recursive parts reduces exponentially with each recursive cycle.
